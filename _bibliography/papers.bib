  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are sensitive to subtle changes in prompt phrasing, complicating efforts to audit them reliably. Prior approaches often rely on arbitrary or ungrounded prompt variations, which may miss key linguistic and demographic factors in real-world usage. We introduce AUGMENT (Automated User-Grounded Modeling and Evaluation of Natural Language Transformations), a framework for systematically generating and evaluating controlled, realistic prompt paraphrases based on linguistic structure and user demographics. AUGMENT ensures paraphrase quality through a combination of semantic, stylistic, and instruction-following criteria. In a case study on the BBQ dataset, we show that user-grounded paraphrasing leads to significant shifts in LLM performance and bias metrics across nine models. Our findings highlight the need for more representative and structured approaches to prompt variation in LLM auditing.},

  abstract = {The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor. This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across several datasets.},

  abstract = {In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example input–output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success, the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we demonstrate through a suite of out‑of‑distribution generalization experiments that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers implementing algorithms such as OLS.  Finally, we highlight the role of the pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique \textit{spectral signature}: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly correlated with low loss.}

This emphasis on scaling up datasets and pre-training computation raises the risk of further consolidating the industry, and enabling monopolistic (or oligopolistic) behavior. Judges and regulators seeking to improve market competition may employ various remedies. This paper explores dissolution -- the breaking up of a monopolistic entity into smaller firms -- as one such remedy, focusing in particular on the technical challenges and opportunities involved in the breaking up of large models and datasets. We show how the framework of Conscious Data Contribution can enable user autonomy during under dissolution.

  abstract = {Tools for analyzing character portrayal in fiction are valuable for writers and literary scholars in developing and interpreting compelling stories. Existing tools, such as visualization tools for analyzing fictional characters, primarily rely on explicit textual indicators of character attributes. However, portrayal is often implicit, revealed through actions and behaviors rather than explicit statements. We address this gap by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to uncover implicit character portrayals. We start by generating a dataset for this task with greater cross-topic similarity, lexical diversity, and narrative lengths than existing narrative text corpora such as TinyStories and WritingPrompts. We then introduce LIIPA (LLMs for Inferring Implicit Portrayal for Character Analysis), a framework for prompting LLMs to uncover character portrayals. LIIPA can be configured to use various types of intermediate computation (character attribute word lists, chain-of-thought) to infer how fictional characters are portrayed in the source text. We find that LIIPA outperforms existing approaches, and is more robust to increasing character counts (number of unique persons depicted) due to its ability to utilize full narrative context. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity of portrayal estimates to character demographics, identifying a fairness-accuracy tradeoff among methods in our LIIPA framework -- a phenomenon familiar within the algorithmic fairness literature. Despite this tradeoff, all LIIPA variants consistently outperform non-LLM baselines in both fairness and accuracy. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using LLMs to analyze complex characters and to better understand how implicit portrayal biases may manifest in narrative texts.},

However, out-of-distribution generalization for regression-the analogous problem for modeling continuous targets-remains relatively unexplored. To tackle this problem, we return to first principles and analyze how the closed-form solution for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is sensitive to covariate shift. We characterize the out-of-distribution risk of the OLS model in terms of the eigenspectrum decomposition of the source and target data. We then use this insight to propose a method for adapting the weights of the last layer of a pre-trained neural regression model to perform better on input data originating from a different distribution. We demonstrate how this lightweight spectral adaptation procedure can improve out-of-distribution performance for synthetic and real-world datasets.},

We observe that fairness often depends on the history of the sequential decision-making process, and in this sense that it is inherently non-Markovian. We further observe that fairness often needs to be assessed at time points {\textless}em{\textgreater}within{\textless}/em{\textgreater} the process, not just at the end of the process. To advance our understanding of this class of fairness problems, we explore the notion of non-Markovian fairness in the context of sequential decision making. We identify properties of non-Markovian fairness, including notions of long-term, anytime, periodic, and bounded fairness. We explore the interplay between non-Markovian fairness and memory and how memory can support construction of fair policies. Finally, we introduce the FairQCM algorithm, which can automatically augment its training data to improve sample efficiency in the synthesis of fair policies via reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is an expressive framework for turning data into computer programs. Across many problem domains -- both in industry and policy settings -- the types of computer programs needed for accurate prediction or optimal control are difficult to write by hand. On the other hand, collecting instances of desired system behavior may be relatively more feasible. This makes ML broadly appealing, but also induces data sensitivities that often manifest as unexpected failure modes during deployment. In this sense, the training data available tend to be imperfect for the task at hand. This thesis explores several data sensitivities of modern machine learning and how to address them. We begin by discussing how to prevent ML from codifying prior human discrimination measured in the training data, where we take a fair representation learning approach. We then discuss the problem of learning from data containing spurious features, which provide predictive fidelity during training but are unreliable upon deployment. Here we observe that insofar as standard training methods tend to learn such features, this propensity can be leveraged to search for partitions of training data that expose this inconsistency, ultimately promoting learning algorithms invariant to spurious features. Finally, we turn our attention to reinforcement learning from data with insufficient coverage over all possible states and actions. To address the coverage issue, we discuss how causal priors can be used to model the single-step dynamics of the setting where data are collected. This enables a new type of data augmentation where observed trajectories are stitched together to produce new but plausible counterfactual trajectories.},

This continuous representation of geometry enables more accurate simulation of fluid-object interactions over long time periods while simultaneously making computation more efficient. Moreover, SURFSUP trained on simple shape primitives generalizes considerably out-of-distribution, even to complex real-world scenes and objects.

    abstract = {The number of states in a dynamic process is exponential in the number of objects, making reinforcement learning (RL) difficult in complex, multi-object domains. For agents to scale to the real world, they will need to react to and reason about unseen combinations of objects. We argue that the ability to recognize and use local factorization in transition dynamics is a key element in unlocking the power of multi-object reasoning. To this end, we show that (1) known local structure in the environment transitions is sufficient for an exponential reduction in the sample complexity of training a dynamics model, and (2) a locally factored dynamics model provably generalizes out-of-distribution to unseen states and actions. Knowing the local structure also allows us to predict which unseen states and actions this dynamics model will generalize to. We propose to leverage these observations in a novel Model-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation (MoCoDA) framework. MoCoDA applies a learned locally factored dynamics model to an augmented distribution of states and actions to generate counterfactual transitions for RL. MoCoDA works with a broader set of local structures than prior work and allows for direct control over the augmented training distribution. We show that MoCoDA enables RL agents to learn policies that generalize to unseen states and actions. We use MoCoDA to train an offline RL agent to solve an out-of-distribution robotics manipulation task on which standard offline RL algorithms fail.},

We propose EIIL, a general framework for domain-invariant learning that incorporates Environment Inference to directly infer partitions that are maximally informative for downstream Invariant Learning. We show that EIIL outperforms invariant learning methods on the CMNIST benchmark without using environment labels, and significantly outperforms ERM on worst-group performance in the Waterbirds dataset.

Concerns have been raised about these systems over their potential for feedback loops that can create unintended consequences such as echochambers, ﬁlter bubbles and polarization in the digital space. In this paper, we measure the effect of prolonged exposure to recommendation on availability of diverse suggested content to the user. We use the deﬁnition of reachability (or user recourse) of Dean et al. (2020b), as the proportion of unseen items that could be recommended to the user in the future, which can be approximated using knowledge of the embedding space geometry for linear recommenders. Whereas previous work assumed a static recommender, we study the case where the recommender can change over time, either by training for longer given a ﬁxed dataset, or dynamically updating its training online through interactions with users. We ﬁnd that dynamic changes to the recommender system do indeed affect the recourse available to users.},

Such local causal structures can be leveraged to improve the sample efficiency of sequence prediction and off-policy reinforcement learning. We formalize this by introducing local causal models (LCMs), which are induced from a global causal model by conditioning on a subset of the state space. We propose an approach to inferring these structures given an object-oriented state representation, as well as a novel algorithm for Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CoDA). CoDA uses local structures and an experience replay to generate counterfactual experiences that are causally valid in the global model.

    abstract = {Robustness is of central importance in machine learning and has given rise to the fields of domain generalization and invariant learning, which are concerned with improving performance on a test distribution distinct from but related to the training distribution. In light of recent work suggesting an intimate connection between fairness and robustness, we investigate whether algorithms from robust ML can be used to improve the fairness of classifiers that are trained on biased data and tested on unbiased data. We apply Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), a domain generalization algorithm that employs a causal discovery inspired method to find robust predictors, to the task of fairly predicting the toxicity of internet comments. We show that IRM achieves better out-of-distribution accuracy and fairness than Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) methods, and analyze both the difficulties that arise when applying IRM in practice and the conditions under which IRM will likely be effective in this scenario. We hope that this work will inspire further studies of how robust machine learning methods relate to algorithmic fairness.},

    abstract = {In many applications areas—lending, education, and online recommenders, for example—fairness and equity concerns emerge when a machine learning system interacts with a dynamically changing environment to produce both immediate and long-term effects for individuals and demographic groups. We discuss causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as a unifying framework for the recent literature on fairness in such dynamical systems. We show that this formulation affords several new directions of inquiry to the modeler, where sound causal assumptions can be expressed and manipulated. We emphasize the importance of computing interventional quantities in the dynamical fairness setting, and show how causal assumptions enable simulation (when environment dynamics are known) and estimation by adjustment (when dynamics are unknown) of intervention on short- and long-term outcomes, at both the group and individual levels.},

    abstract = {Most recommender systems (RS) research assumes that a user’s utility can be maximized independently of the utility of the other agents (e.g., other users, content providers). In realistic settings, this is often not true – the dynamics of an RS ecosystem couple the long-term utility of all agents. In this work, we explore settings in which content providers cannot remain viable unless they receive a certain level of user engagement. We formulate this problem as one of equilibrium selection in the induced dynamical system, and show that it can be solved as an optimal constrained matching problem. Our model ensures the system reaches an equilibrium with maximal social welfare supported by a sufficiently diverse set of viable providers. We demonstrate that even in a simple, stylized dynamical RS model, the standard myopic approach to recommendation - always matching a user to the best provider - performs poorly. We develop several scalable techniques to solve the matching problem, and also draw connections to various notions of user regret and fairness, arguing that these outcomes are fairer in a utilitarian sense.},

Taking inspiration from the disentangled representation learning literature, we propose an algorithm for learning compact representations of datasets that are useful for reconstruction and prediction, but are also flexibly fair, meaning they can be easily modified at test time to achieve subgroup demographic parity with respect to multiple sensitive attributes and their conjunctions. We show empirically that the resulting encoder—which does not require the sensitive attributes for inference—allows for the adaptation of a single representation to a variety of fair classification tasks with new target labels and subgroup definitions.},

We can rephrase this question to ask: which parts of the image, if they were not seen by the classifier, would most change its decision? Producing an answer requires marginalizing over images that could have been seen but weren't. We can sample plausible image in-fills by conditioning a generative model on the rest of the image. We then optimize to find the image regions that most change the classifier's decision after in-fill. Our approach contrasts with ad-hoc in-filling approaches, such as blurring or injecting noise, which generate inputs far from the data distribution, and ignore informative relationships between different parts of the image. Our method produces more compact and relevant saliency maps, with fewer artifacts compared to previous methods.},

Classification algorithms tasked with predicting outcomes accurately from these datasets tend to replicate these biases. We advocate a causal modeling approach to learning from biased data, exploring the relationship between fair classification and intervention. We propose a causal model in which the sensitive attribute confounds both the treatment and the outcome. Building on prior work in deep learning and generative modeling, we describe how to learn the parameters of this causal model from observational data alone, even in the presence of unobserved confounders. We show experimentally that fairness-aware causal modeling provides better estimates of the causal effects between the sensitive attribute, the treatment, and the outcome. We further present evidence that estimating these causal effects can help learn policies that are both more accurate and fair, when presented with a historically biased dataset.},

We connect group fairness (demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) to different adversarial objectives. Through worst-case theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, we show that the choice of this objective is crucial to fair prediction. Furthermore, we present the first in-depth experimental demonstration of fair transfer learning and demonstrate empirically that our learned representations admit fair predictions on new tasks while maintaining utility, an essential goal of fair representation learning.},

Previous work optimized these hyperparmeters via grid search, random search, and black box optimization techniques such as Bayesian optimization. Bolstered by recent advances in gradient-based optimization of discrete stochastic objectives, we instead propose to directly model a distribution over possible architectures and use variational optimization to jointly optimize the network architecture and weights in one training pass. We discuss an implementation of this approach that estimates gradients via the Concrete relaxation, and show that it ﬁnds compact and accurate architectures for convolutional neural networks applied to the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.},

    abstract = {We present Vibrato Nonnegative Tensor Factorization, an algorithm for single-channel unsupervised audio source separation with an application to separating instrumental or vocal sources with nonstationary pitch from music recordings. Our approach extends Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for audio modeling by including local estimates of frequency modulation as cues in the separation. This permits the modeling and unsupervised separation of vibrato or glissando musical sources, which is not possible with the basic matrix factorization formulation. The algorithm factorizes a sparse nonnegative tensor comprising the audio spectrogram and local frequency-slope-to-frequency ratios, which are estimated at each time-frequency bin using the Distributed Derivative Method. The use of local frequency modulations as separation cues is motivated by the principle of common fate partial grouping from Auditory Scene Analysis, which hypothesizes that each latent source in a mixture is characterized perceptually by coherent frequency and amplitude modulations shared by its component partials. We derive multiplicative factor updates by Minorization-Maximization, which guarantees convergence to a local optimum by iteration. We then compare our method to the baseline on two separation tasks: one considers synthetic vibrato notes, while the other considers vibrato string instrument recordings.},

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999) is currently a popular tool for musical source separation (Wang and Plumbley 2005), since it can provide a lowrank approximate factorization of the magnitude spectrogram of the analyzed sound, where the factors can be interpreted as the spectral templates and temporal activations of the notes contributing to the recording. However, NMF implicitly models each source as having a ﬁxed spectral template and is thus ill-suited to the analysis of vibrato sounds, which are characterized by slowly varying frequency and amplitude modulations.},
