	abstract = {This thesis explores the extraction of vibrato sounds from monaural excerpts of polyphonic music using the coherent frequency modulation (CFM) of component partials as a grouping cue. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999) is currently a popular tool for musical source separation (Wang and Plumbley 2005), since it can provide a lowrank approximate factorization of the magnitude spectrogram of the analyzed sound, where the factors can be interpreted as the spectral templates and temporal activations of the notes contributing to the recording. However, NMF implicitly models each source as having a Ô¨Åxed spectral template and is thus ill-suited to the analysis of vibrato sounds, which are characterized by slowly varying frequency and amplitude modulations.},
