Notably, I am now only scheduling interviews for prospective students who have <b>already submitted an MASc or PhD application to University of Waterloo's ECE Department</b>. I have deprecated the google form and, as a general rule, will be responding by email to those with completed applications. Read on for more details. </p> </div> <style>.gray-box{border:1px solid #ccc;background-color:#f5f5f5;padding:10px;margin:10px;border-radius:20px}</style> <p>I lead the <strong>Socially Embedded Machine Intelligence (SEMI)</strong> lab, where we study the social impacts of AI and propose new algorithms to train more trustworthy models. I am actively recruiting students to work on projects within each of following <u>research themes</u>:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Algorithmic Collective Action</strong> How can everyday people steer AI systems toward a common good? Is it possible to influence an AI model without owning its code or model parameters? What are the implications for AI and automation on organizing and grassroots policy advocacy?</li> <li> <strong>Data Attribution</strong> When model outputs surprise us, can we trace their origin back to influential data points (or subsets) from pre-training (or post-training)? What are the implications of model opacity/transparency for AI governance?</li> <li> <strong>Evaluation and Safety</strong> How should we design evaluations for general purpose models with many capabilities? How can we characterize and mitigate the possibility of unsafe model outputs?</li> <li> <strong>AI Ethics in Practice</strong> How are concepts from AI ethics research like fairness and privacy operationalized as design principles for engineers and programmers? Are there gaps in this translation work, and what does this mean for AI policy and regulation?</li> </ol> <p><em>Here are some <u>frequently asked questions</u> about how to join SEMI:</em></p> <p><strong>Are you looking for new students to join your lab?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>How to I submit an MASc or PhD application to University of Waterloo’s ECE department?</strong> Follow the steps outlined <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-graduate-students/admissions/how-to-apply" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. For program, choose MASc or PhD in ECE (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/graduate-studies/future-students/programs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this page</a> for more info), and for research field choose Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI). List my name as a potential supervisor if you would like to work with me.</p> <p><strong>What is the application deadline?</strong> The ECE department has three application deadlines each year:</p> <ul> <li>for admission to the Fall 2026 term, apply by February 1, 2026 (this is the most common option);</li> <li>for admission to the Winter 2027 term, apply by June 1, 2026;</li> <li>for admission to the Spring 2027 term, apply by October 1, 2026.</li> </ul> <p>It is recommended to start your application at least two weeks before the deadline, so that your referees have sufficient time to upload their letters. More info can be found <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/graduate-students/future-graduate-students/admission-requirements" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can I apply to work with you in the Cheriton School of Computer Science?</strong> While this is less typical, I do have courtesy cross appointment in Waterloo’s School of CS, meaning that I can <em>co-supervise</em> MMAth or PhD students at Cheriton, if there is a primary supervisor from CS.</p> <p><strong>How do I make my application stand out?</strong> I like to work with students who have their own unique research interests, have relevant technical background knowledge with an openness to learning more, work well in an interdisciplinary team setting, and care about AI research that has a positive social impact. As a supervisor, my job is to help students realize their full potential as independent researchers, who will eventually be comfortable proposing and leading their own projects, and will participate in collaborations within and beyond the lab. I recommend that you first <em>read a few of my papers and consider the research themes listed above</em>, then write a Statement of Interest that demonstrates your research interests, and how they overlap with the SEMI research themes.</p> <p><strong>Are you accepting international graduate students?</strong> Yes I recruit graduate students at the Master’s and PhD level. International and domestic students are both welcome to apply. <em>Please note</em> that at Waterloo, international Master’s students pay more tuition compared with other grad students (international PhD or domestic Master’s/PhD). The direct-entry PhD program is open to exceptional prospective students who wish to start their PhD without first earning a Master’s. More information about international graduate student funding can be found <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/thinking-applying" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. External scholarships such as the <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/programs/scholarship/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vector Scholarship in AI</a> and <a href="https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OGS</a> are also helpful in offsetting tuition costs.</p> <p><strong>Are you accepting postdocs?</strong> I do accept postdocs who can secure external funding (if there is mutual interest in working together, I will help you apply for relevant opportunities). I expect prospective postdocs to have developed their own unique research interest, and a track record of publications in machine learning conferences or closely related venues.</p> <p><strong>Are you accepting undergraduate students?</strong> I do hire University of Waterloo undergraduates to work as full-time researchers through the University’s co-op program (check WaterlooWorks for openings). I am also available to consult on final-year engineering design projects, especially if they align with my research interests. Unfortunately, I am not able to work with part-time or volunteer undergrad researchers, unless you have already completed a co-op at SEMI.</p> <p><strong>Can I work at SEMI as a non-Waterloo undergraduate student?</strong> While this is less typical, I do consider visiting students through existing internship programs like <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/waterloo-engineering-rising-stars-fellowship-program" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Waterloo Engineering Rising Stars</a>, <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MITACS Globalink Internship</a> and <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/programs/internships/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vector Institute</a>. Please apply to those programs directly.</p> <p><strong>Can I email you directly? When can I expect to hear back?</strong> While I don’t have time to respond to all inquiries, you are welcome to email me. For email inquiries, please attach a CV and transcript (unofficial transcripts are fine). I tend to ignore emails that follow a generic template, or would suggest that more time has been spent prompt engineering an LLM to write your email than has been spent engaging with my research. I am more likely to respond to your email if it contains one or more of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Indication that you have submitted a completed MASc or PhD application to University of Waterloo’s ECE department;</li> <li>Demonstration of an engagement with my papers (tell me which papers you read and what you found interesting, or what was missing);</li> <li>Proposal of research topics that align with the main pillars of my research agenda listed above;</li> <li>Demonstration of an interest in interdisciplinary research (say which other disciplines besides CS/Engineering interest you and why).</li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Elliot Creager.
