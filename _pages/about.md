Welcome to my humble homepage!

I conduct research on how machine learning methods fail, and what can be done to improve their robustness in new contexts.
My methods draw on technical approaches such as representation learning, causal inference, and data augmentation to build models for prediction and control that generalize beyond the available training data.

Meanwhile, I am very interested in analyzing the broader implications of using machine learning to automate decisions, especially the tendency of this process to codify and compound existing social inequities.
