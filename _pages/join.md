### Join my lab!

I have several openings in my lab at [the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). My group studies the societal impacts of machine learning. Our long-term goal is to help foster responsible AI deployment. Towards this end, our current focus is **learning algorithms**: Can we characterize their technical limitations? How can we improve their robustness? And can we design tools to empower the everyday people whose data make up their training sets?

If you would like to join me as a Master's or PhD student, please **fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1LdFBE3Ly-1DcOg3T8epIWLCutrULwzzRJaLJAQxtL6Uayg/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to help me learn more about your background and research interests.
