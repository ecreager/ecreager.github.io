I lead the **Socially Embedded Machine Intelligence (SEMI)** lab, where we study the social impacts of AI and propose new algorithms to train more reliable and equitable models.
There are two main pillars to my research at the moment:
1. *Improving the fairness and robustness properties of foundation models (including LLMs and multi-modal generative models);*
2. *Modeling collective behavior of data subjects (everyday people who contribute data to AI systems) and exploring the possibility of socially beneficial coordinated action amongst them.*

If these topics interest you, and you think I might be a good mentor, please get in touch *after* reading the following FAQs:

**Are you accepting undergraduate students?**
I work with undergraduates exclusively from the University of Waterloo.
I occasionally hire undergraduates as co-op researchers.
I am also available to consult on final-year engineering design projects, especially if they align with my research interests.

**Are you accepting Master's students?**
Yes.
Please note that Waterloo's current funding structure makes it relatively expensive (specifically from a tuition perspective) for international Master's students to join my lab.
More information about international graduate student funding can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/thinking-applying).
External scholarships such as the [Vector Scholarship in AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai/programs/scholarship/) are also helpful in offsetting tuition costs.

**Are you accepting PhD students?**
Yes.
Because the PhD is a larger commitment of time and effort (both for the student and supervisor), the bar for entry is higher.
In Canada we expect all prospective PhD students to have already earned a Master's degree in Engineering or CS.
In exceptional cases, prospective students without a Master's can be considered for direct entry into the PhD program.

**Are you accepting postdocs?**
I do accept postdocs who can secure external funding (if there is mutual interest in working together, I will help you apply for relevant opportunities).
I expect prospective postdocs to have developed their own unique research interest, and a track record of publications in machine learning conferences or closely related venues.

**How to I get admitted to SEMI?**
At the graduate level (Master's or PhD), I am only able to consider your application if you complete both of the following steps
1. **Fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1LdFBE3Ly-1DcOg3T8epIWLCutrULwzzRJaLJAQxtL6Uayg/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to help me learn more about your background and research interests.
2. Submit an application ("MASc" for Master's, or PhD) to the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the University of Waterloo.

More information on the ECE department's graduate programs can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/graduate-studies/future-students/programs), and general information on applying to University of Waterloo can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-graduate-students/admissions/how-to-apply).

**Getting in touch**
While I can only accept prospective graduate students who have applied to Waterloo ECE, it may be helpful to get in touch with me, either before or after you apply (step 2 above). 
My email address is listed on my CV.
When emailing me, please include copy of your CV and past transcripts (unofficial transcripts are fine) to give me a sense of your academic background and prior work/research experience.
*Please include the phrase "brilliant binoculars" in the subject line of your email to indicate you have read this FAQ.*

**When can I expect to hear back from you?:** While I make an effort to engage with prospective students, please note that I cannot respond to every message due to the high volume of inquiries.
I am more likely to respond to your email if it contains one or more of the following:
* Confirmation that you have submitted your information to the google form above;
* Indication that you have applied (or plan to apply) to the ECE department;
* Demonstration of an engagement with my papers (tell me which papers you read and what you found interesting, or what was missing);
* Proposal of research topics that align with the main pillars of my research agenda listed above;
* Demonstration of an interest in interdisciplinary research (say which other disciplines besides CS/Engineering interest you and why).
