If you need a third-person biographical profile of me for an event, you may use the following text:

His research focuses on building reliable and equitable AI systems that promote user data autonomy. Creager is a Faculty Affiliate of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society. He is also a member of the Waterloo Data and Artificial Intelligence Institute, the Waterloo Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute, and (by courtesy cross appointment) the David R.
